I like to list my favorite tools, so I can keep track of them and I can share them with my mates and friends.
* [Windows SysInternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/): Collection of the best and most advanced system tools for the windows operating system. It has many tools that deserve their own separate entry. 
* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/): Why is my hard disk full? The best free tool I found to answer this question.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my favorite general purpose editor. Specially when working in a 'Directory'. I regularly use it for python, HTML, LaTeX, C++, Jekyll, ... .
* [ConEMU](https://conemu.github.io): I open many terminal windows for various tasks. It's nice to have them all in one window, but different tabs.
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) I really enjoy listening to musics  and have my playlists everywhere and also notice for new songs, so spotify will handle them for me. you can use it free or with a premium account.
